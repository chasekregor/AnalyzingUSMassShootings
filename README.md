### Dataset:
The dataset contains detailed information of 398 mass shootings in the United States of America that killed 1996 and injured 2488 people.

### Purpose:
To have a better understanding of mass shootings in the US.

### Topics I Explored:
* How many people got killed and injured per year?
* Is there any correlation between shooter and his/her race, gender
* Any correlation with calendar dates? Do we have more deadly days, weeks or months on average?
* What cities and states are more prone to such attacks
* Can you find and combine any other external datasets to enrich the analysis, for example, gun ownership by state?
* Any other pattern you see that can help in prediction, crowd safety or in-depth analysis of the event?
* How many shooters have some kind of mental health problem? Can we compare that shooter with general population with same condition?
